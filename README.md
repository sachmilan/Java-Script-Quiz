# Java Script Quiz game

## Description

-I think that it is hard and confusing to learn the Java Script, and I think that the best way to learn it is by understanding the basics of Java script. So, I created this quiz cum game which will test your basic understanding of it. Moreover, if we play a game with our peers, this will bring a spirit of competetion among us, thus ultimately help us to improve our skills.

-To achieve my goal, I made this application, which will ask questions to students, thus help them learn Java Script better.

-It will help the students to test their knowledge for Java Script in a quick and competative way, as there is a timer in the quiz. The students have to answer the questions within 80 seconds, plus to beef up the excitement, if someone answered any question wrong, they will be penalized by a penality of 15 seconds.

-Java script was totally new to me, so I learned it and used it in a way which enhances my understanding of it.
